MUA (Mail User Agent)

A Mail User Agent (MUA) is a software application used to send and receive email. It provides an interface for users to interact with their emails (e.g., Outlook, Thunderbird, Gmail). The MUA retrieves emails from a mail server and allows users to compose, send, read, and organize their messages.
MTA (Mail Transfer Agent)

A Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) is responsible for transferring email messages between mail servers. It acts as the backbone of email delivery systems, forwarding and routing messages to their destination. Popular MTAs include Postfix, Exim, and Sendmail.
SPF (Sender Policy Framework)

Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is an email authentication protocol that helps prevent email spoofing by verifying the sender's IP address. It works by checking the DNS records of the domain to ensure the email is coming from an authorized source. SPF helps reduce the chances of spam and phishing attacks.
DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)

DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) is an email authentication method that allows the receiver to check if the email was indeed sent and authorized by the owner of the domain. It uses cryptographic signatures added to the email headers, providing additional protection against email tampering during transmission.
