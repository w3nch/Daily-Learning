## Incident Response Lifecycle

### NIST Framework
The NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) framework provides a structured approach to incident response, emphasizing continuous improvement.

1. **Preparation**  
   In this phase, organizations establish and maintain an incident response capability. This includes:
   - Developing an incident response policy and plan.
   - Training personnel and conducting simulations to test the response plan.
   - Ensuring appropriate tools and resources are in place.

2. **Detection and Analysis**  
   This phase involves identifying and assessing potential security incidents:
   - Monitoring security alerts, logs, and events for unusual activity.
   - Analyzing data to confirm whether an incident has occurred and determine its nature and scope.

3. **Containment, Eradication, and Recovery**  
   Once an incident is confirmed, it is crucial to contain the threat and eliminate it:
   - **Containment**: Implementing measures to limit the impact of the incident and prevent further damage.
   - **Eradication**: Identifying and removing the root cause of the incident, such as malware or unauthorized access.
   - **Recovery**: Restoring affected systems to normal operations while ensuring that the threat has been fully addressed.

4. **Post-Incident Activity**  
   After recovery, organizations analyze the incident to improve future responses:
   - Conducting a retrospective analysis of the incident to identify lessons learned.
   - Updating incident response plans and security measures based on findings.

### SANS Framework
The SANS Institute provides a detailed framework for incident response, emphasizing continuous improvement and learning.

1. **Preparation**  
   Similar to the NIST framework, this involves establishing a strong incident response capability.

2. **Identification**  
   This step focuses on detecting and confirming incidents:
   - Gathering and analyzing evidence to identify the scope and impact of the incident.

3. **Containment**  
   Implementing immediate measures to limit the damage and prevent further impact.

4. **Eradication**  
   Removing the root cause of the incident from the environment.

5. **Recovery**  
   Restoring systems and operations to normal while ensuring that all threats have been eliminated.

6. **Lessons Learned**  
   Reviewing the incident to improve future response efforts and prevent recurrence.

### Lockheed Martin Kill Chain
The Lockheed Martin Kill Chain framework outlines the stages of a cyber attack, providing insight into how attackers operate.

1. **Reconnaissance**  
   Gathering information about the target to identify vulnerabilities.

2. **Weaponization**  
   Creating a malicious payload designed to exploit identified vulnerabilities.

3. **Delivery**  
   Transmitting the weaponized payload to the target through methods such as email attachments or malicious links.

4. **Exploitation**  
   Triggering the payload to exploit the vulnerability and gain access to the target system.

5. **Installation**  
   Installing malware or backdoors to maintain access to the compromised system.

6. **Command and Control (C2)**  
   Establishing a communication channel between the compromised system and the attacker's infrastructure.

7. **Action on Objectives**  
   Executing the attacker's goals, which may include data exfiltration, disruption of services, or other malicious actions.

### MITRE ATT&CK Framework
The MITRE ATT&CK framework provides a comprehensive mapping of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries:

- **Tactics**: High-level objectives that adversaries aim to achieve during an attack (e.g., initial access, execution, persistence).
- **Techniques**: Specific methods used to achieve each tactic (e.g., phishing for initial access).
- **Procedures**: Detailed descriptions of how techniques are implemented by threat actors.

This framework helps organizations understand adversary behavior, allowing for better defense strategies and incident response planning.
