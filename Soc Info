What is a SOC?

A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a team of security professionals who work together to monitor, detect, analyze, and mitigate security threats. The goal of a SOC is to defend an organization's IT environment 24/7, 365 days a year. SOCs can be classified into three types:

    In-house SOC: Managed and operated by the organization's own staff.
    Outsourced SOC: Managed by a third-party provider.
    Hybrid SOC: A combination of in-house and outsourced SOC services.

SOCs follow various methodologies, playbooks, and techniques to provide continuous security and threat management.
Key Functions of a SOC

The main functions of a SOC can be summarized in three key actions:

    Monitor: Continuously watch for potential security threats in real-time.
    Detect: Identify threats and incidents that need attention.
    Respond: Take appropriate action to mitigate and address security incidents.

These functions follow a cycle that repeats and improves over time, evolving as threats and technologies change.

At its core, a SOC revolves around People, Processes, and Technology:

    People: Security professionals that operate and manage the SOC.
    Processes: Standard operating procedures and playbooks followed to ensure efficient handling of security incidents.
    Technology: Security tools and platforms used to monitor, detect, and respond to threats.

Roles in a SOC

    Security Analysts (SOC L1):
        Initial monitoring and alert triage.
        Determine if alerts are true positives or false negatives.
        Escalate incidents as needed.

    Senior Security Analysts (SOC L2):
        Conduct deeper analysis of incidents.
        Handle escalated issues and provide advanced troubleshooting.

    Incident Responders (SOC L3):
        Lead incident response efforts.
        Perform root cause analysis and recovery procedures.

    Threat Hunter:
        Proactively search for threats before they cause damage.
        Analyze potential threat actor behavior and tools.

    Threat Intelligence Analyst:
        Analyze threat intelligence data to understand trends and inform security strategies.

    Security Engineer:
        Design and implement security systems and infrastructure.
        Manage tools like firewalls, SIEM, and other security products.

    SOC Manager:
        Oversee daily operations, ensuring processes are followed.
        Implement effective measures to keep the SOC running efficiently.

Tools Used in a SOC

Security tools play a critical role in enabling the SOC team to perform their tasks, but they are just tools. Commonly used tools include:

    SIEM (Security Information and Event Management): Collects and correlates security event data for monitoring and analysis.
    SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response): Automates and coordinates responses to security incidents.
    EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response): Monitors endpoints for suspicious activity.
    WAF (Web Application Firewall): Protects web applications from various attacks.
    IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems): Monitors network traffic to detect and prevent security threats.

Daily Life of a SOC L1 Analyst

    Monitor: Continuously review logs, alerts, and dashboards.
    Triage: Analyze alerts to determine if they are legitimate threats (true positives) or harmless (false negatives).
    Escalate: Pass unresolved or severe issues to higher-level analysts (L2 or L3).
    Recommend: Provide recommendations to resolve security issues or improve defenses.

SOC’s Primary Objective: CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)

The SOC’s mission is to protect the organization's Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability of data and systems. This is the core principle of any SOC's security strategy.
