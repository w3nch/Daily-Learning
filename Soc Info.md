Security Operations Center (SOC) Overview
What is a SOC?

A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a team of security professionals working together to monitor, detect, analyze, and mitigate security threats 24/7, 365 days a year. There are three types of SOCs:

    In-house SOC: Managed internally by an organization's own staff.
    Outsourced SOC: Managed by a third-party provider.
    Hybrid SOC: A combination of in-house and outsourced services.

SOCs follow structured methodologies and playbooks to ensure continuous threat management and security.
Key Functions of a SOC

The SOC operates in a continuous cycle of:

    Monitor - Real-time threat monitoring.
    Detect - Identification of security incidents.
    Respond - Taking action to mitigate and address security threats.

These actions are supported by the following pillars:

    People: The skilled security professionals in the SOC.
    Processes: Standard procedures and playbooks for handling incidents.
    Technology: Security tools and systems used for monitoring, detection, and response.

SOC Roles

    Security Analysts (SOC L1):
        Initial monitoring and triage.
        Determine whether alerts are true positives or false negatives.
        Escalate incidents to higher levels.

    Senior Security Analysts (SOC L2):
        Deeper investigation of incidents.
        Handle escalations from L1 and provide advanced analysis.

    Incident Responders (SOC L3):
        Lead incident response efforts.
        Perform root cause analysis and remediation.

    Threat Hunter:
        Proactively search for potential threats.
        Analyze attacker behaviors and tools.

    Threat Intelligence Analyst:
        Analyze threat intelligence data to understand trends.
        Provide actionable insights to the team.

    Security Engineer:
        Design and implement security systems.
        Manage tools like firewalls, SIEM, and other security platforms.

    SOC Manager:
        Oversee day-to-day operations and ensure processes are being followed.
        Implement effective security measures.

Tools Used in a SOC

A SOC uses various security tools, such as:

    SIEM (Security Information and Event Management):
    Collects, analyzes, and correlates security event data.

    SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response):
    Automates responses to security incidents.

    EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response):
    Monitors and responds to threats at the endpoint level.

    WAF (Web Application Firewall):
    Protects web applications from attacks.

    IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems):
    Detects and prevents malicious network activities.

Daily Life of an SOC L1 Analyst

    Monitor security alerts and logs.
    Triage to determine if alerts are real threats (true positive) or false alarms (false negatives).
    Escalate issues to L2/L3 if necessary.
    Recommend resolutions or improvements based on findings.

SOC's Key Mission: Protect the CIA Triad

The SOC's main goal is to protect the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability of an organization's data and systems, ensuring a secure and stable environment.
